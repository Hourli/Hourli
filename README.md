### Description
An app for independent contractors or anyone that charges an hourly fee for their services.

Users can create jobs, create tasks for each job and record how long they worked on each task, what it involved, etc.

Once the job is complete, the user will be able to create an invoice and send it to the customer.

This app will make the lives easier of many, even private cleaning staff.

The user will be able to set an hourly fee for the entire job, or for each task.

The user will also be able to charge fees for miscellaneous services and include them in the total cost, which will then of course appear on the invoice in detail.

The app could be integrated with paypal or any third-party payment platform to make it even easier to work with. (not part of MVP)
